What states are models of high-quality care?For this exercise, I intend to find the states that are models of high quality care. I use the same approach that I used for finding the hospitals with models of high quality care. I will primarily use the data from the Timely and Effective Care file, which has been stored and transformed into the  “time_effec_info” table, to answer this question. I will then compare the results from the analysis of the Timely and Effective Care data to the scores of performance from the Readmissions and Deaths data – stored and transformed into the read_deaths_info table – to ensure that my analysis from the Timely and Effective Care data makes sense.My approach to answering this question is to evaluate states based on the “conditions” measure. These conditions are Emergency Department, Surgical Care Improvement Project, Children’s Asthma, Heart Failure, Stroke Care, Pneumonia, Preventive Care, Blood Clot Prevention and Treatment, Heart Attack or Chest Pain, and Pregnancy and Delivery Care. In order to evaluate these conditions, I find the average score of these conditions in each state, with the assumption that states with the highest scores for a condition are best at treating the respective condition. I then rank the states’ performance on each of these conditions in descending order, with the states with the highest scores getting the top rankings and those states with the lowest scores getting the bottom rankings.In order to measure whether or not a state consistently receives high scores for a variety of procedures I thought it was best to calculate the average rankings for each state across all conditions. The states with the 10 best ranks are listed in the table below. The state in first place, Virginia, has an average rank of 10.7, and the state in 10th place, Pennsylvania has an average rank of 17.2. To ensure that these rankings are consistent with the data in the Readmissions and Deaths table - that I believe should also provide a good measure of states’ healthcare quality - I calculated the average scores for each state from the Readmissions and Deaths data. Note that unfortunately, the Readmissions and Deaths data did not contain a “conditions” measure, so I just use the average of all scores for each respective state. The comparison with the scores from the Readmissions and Deaths data suggest that the states in my top 10 are all near to the average (14.0), and well above the minimum score (1.6), so I am comfortable with the rankings I obtained from the analysis on the Timely and Effective Care data.  StateAverage Rank Across Conditions from Timely and Effective CareAverage Score in Readmissions and Deaths1VA                                                    10.714.32FL10.913.93MD12.414.04NJ12.814.15NC13.214.06UT13.813.57MA15.413.78CT15.413.89ID16.813.710PA17.213.8
