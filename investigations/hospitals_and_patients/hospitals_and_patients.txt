Are average scores for hospital quality correlated with patient survey responses?In order to answer the question of whether or not average scores for hospital quality are correlated with patient survey responses I use the data from the Survey Responses file, in particular the “surv_resp_info” table that I created. The Survey Response data provided feedback on Nurse’s, Doctor’s and Staff’s performance, Pain management, Communication about Medicine, Clean and Quiet hospital environment, Hospital Discharge measurement and overall scores which measure the overall hospital’s achievement, improvement and dimension. I calculate the average score for each of the 10 measurements above by hospital.I then compare the average score of these 10 measurements at each hospital to the respective hospital ranking measures obtained in the “best_hospital” exercise. I compare them by calculating the correlation between each of the 10 survey performance average measures above and the hospital rankings. I would expect the 10 correlations to each be negative as a larger hospital ranking  -lower down on the list - would signal a lower quality hospital, which would presumably result in low scores on survey responses. Indeed, my results show a negative correlation between all 10 measures and the hospital rankings, suggesting that there appears to be a negative relationship as expected.  This also allows me to feel more confident about my hospital ranking procedure.Survey ResponsesCorrelation with Hospital RankingTotal Achievement-0.23Pain Dimension-0.22Medicine Dimension-0.19Nurse Dimension-0.17Discharge Dimension-0.04Staff Dimension-0.17Total Improvement-0.08Total Dimension-0.21Clean and Quiet Dimension-0.18Doctor Dimension-0.18
